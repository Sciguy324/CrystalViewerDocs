More info on specification can be found here LAMMPS .dat Data file format used by LAMMPS. More info on specifications can be found here TAD3 .dat Data file format used by the TAD3 simulator. It is worth noting that the program can import some types of information from a .xyz file's comment line (second line of the file). Any such information is expected to take the format of comma-separated key: value pairs. For example: Foo: 10, Bar: -0.12 Currently, the only information that will be read is bounding box information.

It will first run a pre-minimizer job if it detects one hasn't been run already. If it detects the pre-minimizer has been run (meaning you've run this script before), this step will be skipped. Generally, you will not need to worry about this preparation step. The master job script will then schedule each division as a separate job. These jobs will first wait for the pre-minimizer to finish before running themselves. Depending on how many paths you're simulating, it may take some time for them to complete.

Additionally, any barriers that failed to compute\u2014whether from failing to converge or from job time limits\u2014will be saved to /Missing Barriers/Missing.csv . You may want to check/download this file in case any such issues occurred. Then, load your structure back in. For convenience, a template file (named template.gz ) was automatically added to the simulation directory upon initial generation. That way, you can restore the complete initial setup for reference. Next, load the energy barriers into the viewer using the \"Migration Paths\" panel. Now that your barriers are loaded in, it's possible that some of them didn't converge properly.

It will first run a pre-minimizer job if it detects one hasn't been run already. If it detects the pre-minimizer has been run (meaning you've run this script before), this step will be skipped. Generally, you will not need to worry about this preparation step. The master job script will then schedule each division as a separate job. These jobs will first wait for the pre-minimizer to finish before running themselves. Depending on how many paths you're simulating, it may take some time for them to complete. Once finished, a final compilation script will run automatically, compiling the energy barriers into a single table found in /Compiled Energy Barriers/[NAME] Barriers.csv . Finally, any paths that failed to run\u2014whether due to convergence issues or the cluster having a bad day\u2014will be logged to /Missing Barriers/Missing.csv .

Next, load the energy barriers into the viewer using the \"Migration Paths\" panel. Now that your barriers are loaded in, it's possible that some of them didn't converge properly.

Essentially, simulations are divided up into \"divisions,\" within which several simulations are run in series. Then, each division is scheduled as a separate job using slurm. Field Description Sites Per Division Number of sites to simulate in each division Division Count Total number of divisions to create The remaining options configure the minimizer. These are identical to the settings used in the regular minimizer : Field Description Minimizer Style Method to use for minimizing. More information on minimizer styles can be found here Energy Tolerance Minimizer terminates when the ratio between the energy change and energy magnitude is less than this value. Set to 0.0 to disable Force Tolerance Stopping tolerance for length of global force vector. Set to 0.0 to disable Max. Steps Maximum number of steps to run the minimizer Max. Force Calls Maximum number of force evaluations before terminating the minimizer Minimizer Timeout Maximum time, in seconds, to run an individual NEB before terminating. Useful for preventing non-converging simulations from hogging compute time","title":"Site Minimizer Options"},{"location":"Simulations/TAD3/","text":"Temperature Accelerated Dynamics (TAD) Temperature accelerated dynamics (TAD) is a method that runs a simulation at a higher temperature to generate results for a lower temperature. The higher temperature allows for jumps to be sampled far faster than if the simulation were run at the lower temperature. It is accessible in the \"LAMMPS - TAD3\" tab of the simulation generator dialog : Note: This simulation does not use LAMMPS or slurm. Instead, it requires the TAD3 simulator to be compiled and installed on your machine. A fork of it is available here . Requirements In order to build a TAD simulation, a structure with a non-zero bounding box must already be set up in the viewer: Additionally, any atom marked as a vacancy (including starting vacancies ) will be deleted upon generation. General Options The first set of options involve basic information about the simulation and structure: Field Description Working Directory Location to generate the files to Secondary Name Name of simulation. This will decide the name of the output directory Structure Name Name of structure. Used in deciding file names of simulation outputs Mass Table Atomic masses to use in the simulation.
